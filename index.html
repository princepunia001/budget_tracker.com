<h1>What Is Budget Tracker? </h1>
</div>
<p>
    Budget tracking is the process of tracking expenses, receipts, and invoices so that a project can be completed within its allotted budget. Budget tracking can be done using budgeting and forecasting software. Project management software can also be used, in which case the budget details the anticipated expenses and profit for a specific project.Tracking budgets also give teams the opportunity to offset extra expenses before itâ€™s too late. With budget tracking, teams can easily identify budget items that need more funding than anticipated. Funds can be reallocated to compensate for this so that the project can be completed without going over budget.  <br>
